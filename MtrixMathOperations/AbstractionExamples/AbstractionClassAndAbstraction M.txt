Abstraction Class and Abstraction Method
----------------------------------------
1.An abstract method is a method in which declaration is provided but not implementation(method declaration is called signature).

2. A class with one or more abstract methods declared as abstract that class should also be declared as abstract and such class can not be instantiated because it is incomplete.

3.A class that inherits abstract class must override all the abstract members else that class should be marked as Abstract.
(Abstract=Pure virtual)

4.We can create abstract class without abstract members and such class even cant be instantiated.

5.abstract method can not be created with private access modifier and it cant be static as well.

6.Abstract class object can be assigned with reference of derived class and the object of abstract class and now can access its members and overridden methods.
